    <h1>First Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        The idea from Susan Sontage’s Plato’s Cave is a new idea to me viewing the image
        taking. She talked about the power of photography and image making, which is using
        it for recording incriminates, and looking at the world through the photo, 
        like traveling. Personally, to capture images and create graphics is because 
        I want to record the moment and scenery that I like, as it stores in the camera 
        or in the photo album, and it will become part of my memory storage.  
        I also agree that photography promotes nostalgia. If one day I forgot what I 
        saw before, the image will become the evidence or the key to the locker of 
        my memories storage, and then it will remind me about the time and the scene 
        of the image again. She also brings the idea about the emotion connected to 
        photography as she mentioned the Vietnam War. I found it painful to see someone 
        suffering, it reminded me of the picture about the Vietnam War in the last 
        lecture. A few soldiers behind those kids, and those kids looked like they 
        were lost and in pain. Maybe the photographer expresses the idea in a brutal way,
        to record someone’s pain, make the public hate the war and against the war. 
        The emotion connected to the picture is pretty strong. Photography is also 
        the history itself. Photography also plays a role or meaning in different 
        cultures. In China, black and white photos symbolize the past and even death. 
        Only dead people have black and white portraits. But it has a different meaning 
        in the Western World. As photography always reflects reality, photography exposes
        more of the dark side that we can't imagine, since photos are often more 
        shocking than hearsay. Especially now that the influence of the media on 
        people’s views. I would use image-making to show the power of the media . 
        For example, I will pick a controversial topic, and compare two different 
        opinions in two posts. For example, At this moment, our world as I viewed 
        it was numb and insecure. I imagined I could take a picture of a misty, 
        overcast sky, with no clear view of the clouds and the crowds that crowded 
        in the city.
