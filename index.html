        I am Irene He, from China and currently living in Queens.
        My creative work is always about imagination and characters,
        or stories from novels, TV series, or movies. I love listening
        to music and watching music videos. The content of the music
        video combined together gave me a strong sense of feeling that
        connected to me. My imagination always brings the bridge to connect
        the song and characters, or stories.Thatâ€™s making me want to make a
        lyric video or music video of a song, to translate the feeling of the
        song and the emotion of the lyric to the audience through visual arts.
        I got inspired by two YouTuber called Blue Studio and Vicky Tsai.
        They both edit video and images. They always have excellent ideas to
        translate lyrics of English songs to Chinese and to express the emotion
        of the song through visual arts. Their work style is simple and fresh.
