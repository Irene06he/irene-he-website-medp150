    <h1>Image Compare and Explantation</h1>
    <div id = "imageContainer">
        <img src="exit-ori.JPG" width="400px">
        <img src="exit.jpg" width="200px"> 
    </div>  
    <p>I chose the picture because it is more easily to crop in the 5 X 7 inch.
      I move the exit door in the center of the picture. I decided to make it looks like the exit door in the hospital of a horror movie.
      I adjusted the level input down to 0.45, it gave the sense of horron movies.
      Then adjusted the lightness of hue& saturation decreased to -30.
