    <p>I choose the picture because it is dark and I want to make it more bright.
      First, I cropped and zoom in the picture that let the hawk in the center of the picture. 
      Second, I chose the exposure of adjustments and increased it to 3.35. Then chose curve more lighter.
      Final, I made the picture purple clearly, but the background color turned into green.
